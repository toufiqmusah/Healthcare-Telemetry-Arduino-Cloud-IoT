# Healthcare Telemetry with Arduino Cloud IoT
Healthcare telemetry is the remote monitoring and transmission of biological signals from the body, to support medical diagnosis, treatment, and fitness monitoring.Â In this project, a custom sensor (MAX30102) is interfaced with an Arduino Nano RP2040 to collect biological signals, which are then transmitted to an Arduino Cloud dashboard for monitoring.
